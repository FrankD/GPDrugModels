# Gaussian Process Models for Drug Response

This repository collects two pieces of software that implement the methods described in Wang et al. (to appear), "A statistical framework for assessing pharmacological response and biomarkers with confidence":

  * A Gaussian process model for estimation of drug response from dosage-response curves, implemented in Python using the GPFlow package. This can be found in the GPDrugResponseFitting folder.
  * A Bayesian model for estimation of biomarker associations in the presence of drug response measurements with uncertainty quantification, implemented in R using the stan modelling language. This can be found in the bayesbiomarkertest folder. 
  
For more information, please refer to the package documentation in the subfolders.
