# Using Gaussian processes for fitting drug response curves

A Python package for fitting drug response curves using Gaussian processes. The Gaussian process fitting is done using the GPflow package.

## Pre-requisites:
Python 3.6.9
Tensorflow 1.14.0 (not compatible with Tensorflow 2)
GPflow 1.5.1 

Installation instructions for GPflow can be found here:
https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow

Installation instructions for tensorflow can be found here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

However, the default installation for GPflow should in principle install tensorflow as a dependency, so try that first. Note that you do not need the GPU libraries for tensorflow to run GPflow or the drug response fitting code.

## Running the code

Documentation is still in development, but `run_gp_fitting.py` is a script that fits the an example dataset of 10 dose-response curves, returning estimates for AUC and IC50 and saving a plot for each curve. Note that this requires the GDSC raw drug response dataset as input data, placed in the data folder.

Any warnings about depreciations when running the code are due to issues between the tensorflow and GPflow libraries; these should be resolved when I update the code to use Tensorflow 2.0 (work in progress).
